# Specifies the full path to the log file which this
# server will dump log output to
SERVERLOG = neshare.log

# Defines the maximum number of users this server will allow.
MAXNUMUSERS = 384

# Defines the maximum number of threaded handlers to start.
# Threaded handlers are basically threads in a thread pool
# used for handling 'expensive' operations to offload work
# from the main server listener thread in order to keep it
# more responsive when messages are flooding in.
# For a server handling heavier loads, bump this value up
# to a reasonable limit.  It is configured to a default which
# may not handle the expected load of your server.
NUMTHREADEDHANDLERS = 4

# Defines a maximum number of threaded user managers to start.
# A User Manager is a logical grouping of connected users and is
# used primarily for dividing up the users, reading messages from
# their sockets, and placing the messages into the threaded
# handler message queues.  The number of user managers should
# generally be no more than the number of threaded handlers, but
# you are free to experiment for your server load.
NUMUSERMANAGERS = 4

# Defines the maximum number of sequential messages on a single
# user to handle at once.  This essentially prioritizes the
# current user at the expense of all other users if it set high.
# 1 is the default, but you can experiment with other values.
MAXNUMMESSAGESTOHANDLE = 1

# Defines the maximum amount of time the server will wait
# for a connected client to send I/O before disconnecting.
# NOTE: Make sure this value is NOT higher than the
# USERPINGDELAY option so that an idle (yet properly connected
# connected client can remain a part of the network for
# extended periods of time).
# This value is in seconds.
USERTTL = 180


# Defines how often this server wants to ping each connected
# client.  A pong message from the client is expected, so
# setting this value too low will create unnecessary traffic.
# This value is in seconds.
USERPINGDELAY = 1


# Defines how often the server should send out status
# information to all connected clients.  This includes the
# number of users, the number of shared files, and the
# number of MBs connected users are sharing.
USERSTATUSDELAY = 1


# This limits the number of search results sent back to
# any user for any query.
MAXRESULTS = 3000


# Defines the port that this server should listen on.
SERVERACCEPTPORT = 12414


# Rejects users that share less than this number of MB
# 0 means that there is no limit
# i.e. if set to 100, a new user trying to share less
# than 100 MBs of files will be rejected.
MINUSERSHAREDFILELIMIT = 0


# Now supported (as of neshare-0.2.2).
# If not specified, simple default messages are used.
#GOODBYEMESSAGEFILE = goodbye.txt
#GREETINGMESSAGEFILE = greeting.txt
#LOGINFAILEDMESSAGEFILE = loginfailed.txt
#INVALIDMESSAGETYPEFILE = invalidmessage.txt

# The userfilepagefile is a file that the neshareserver
# uses during runtime.  Please specify this if you're
# running neshareserver-0.2.5 or above.
# For performance reasons, it may benefit to have this
# file reside on a ram disk.
