         NEshare

Using the NEshare (0.2.3+) libraries with your projects
=======================================================

Include the following lines in your project's configure.in file:

dnl ----------------------------------
dnl start neshare related checks here
dnl ----------------------------------
NESHARE_PATH=""

AC_ARG_WITH(neshare,
            [  --with-neshare=DIR      path to installed neshare package],
            NESHARE_PATH=$withval,
            NESHARE_PATH="/usr/local")

AC_CHECK_FILE("$NESHARE_PATH/include/neclientheaders.h", ,
   AC_MSG_ERROR("cannot find neclientheaders.h header file."))

AC_CHECK_FILE("$NESHARE_PATH/include/neserverheaders.h", ,
   AC_MSG_ERROR("cannot find neserverheaders.h header file."))

AC_CHECK_FILE("$NESHARE_PATH/include/necommonheaders.h", ,
   AC_MSG_ERROR("cannot find necommonheaders.h header file."))

AC_CHECK_FILE("$NESHARE_PATH/lib/libnescommon.la", ,
   AC_MSG_ERROR("cannot find neshare common library."))

AC_CHECK_FILE("$NESHARE_PATH/lib/libnesclient.la", ,
   AC_MSG_ERROR("cannot find neshare client library."))

AC_SUBST(NESHARE_PATH)
dnl ----------------------------------
dnl end neshare related checks here
dnl ----------------------------------

Also, add the appropriate lines in your Makefile.am files along the
lines of this:

INCLUDES = -I@NESHARE_PATH@/include \
           other-include-dirs/

main_LDADD = -L@NESHARE_PATH@/lib -lnesclient -lnescommon \
             other-libs-here


Using the NEshare server
========================
Copy the file named config from ./ne_server/config to the same directory as
the neshareserver binary.  Customize it for your own server and run the
neshareserver.

You can test the server with the test client located at 
./ne_clienttest/neshare_client

For information on running your own server, please go to:

http://www.thecodefactory.org/neshare/serverdocs.php3

As of neshare-0.2.5, a default config file will be generated if you run the
neshareserver.  It require you to re-run the server so that you may have a
change to edit the default settings for your environment.

Documentation
=============

Protocol Documentation: please refer to protocol.sxw (OpenOffice document)
Class Documentation: please refer to classdocs.sxw (OpenOffice document)

NEshare is a Peer-to-Peer file sharing toolkit started by Neill Miller
in free time. The implementation I've written is from scratch in C++
and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL). Similarly, the protocol is distributed Freely, as well as
various libraries for integrating the peer-to-peer functionality into
your own applications easily. 

NEshare stands for two things really. First, it's a credit to myself
for attempting to make it happen. My name is Neill, so the "NE" is
from my name. Needless to say, there's a cute pun in the name because
the "NE" is also pronounced any - which implies that any kind of file
can be shared using the protocol and the toolkit.

NEshare has been tested on GNU/Linux systems running on x86 (Intel and
AMD) and PowerPC (Motorola/Apple PPC) architectures.

NEshare uses a thin networking and thread library also written by Neill Miller
called NetClass.
