NESHARE 0.2.6 RELEASE NOTES:
----------------------------
Changes:
- code now honors std namespace (and now gcc-3.x compliant)
- changed the initial max num peers to be 5 instead of 0
- stability fixes for peer handling of disconnected peers
  (no longer try to remove already removed peers)
- properly compile on freebsd and openbsd due to compatible pthread
  configure and ncMutex checks
- added proper ChangeLog entries

	
NESHARE 0.2.5 RELEASE NOTES:
----------------------------
Changes:
- Added a AC_PREREQ(2.50) line configure.in; requiring autoconf 2.53
- Added server generation of config file with default values if one
  does not exist.  Server will warn admin and exit so that the admin
  has a chance to edit the file before running with the default config.
- A new method for storing the neUserFile objects has been implemented
  using a 'disk mem allocator' which stores and executes all of
  these objects (which ordinarily use quite a bit of RAM) from disk.
  The files are mmap'd into memory and used as normal - making the
  code base changes rather minimal.
- Added two config file options:
  USERFILEPAGEFILE - which is a base file template for storing the
  neUserFile objects on disk, and
  NUMRESERVEDUSERFILES - which specifies the initial amount to
  allocate on disk (even though the disk mem allocator is growable, a
  large initial setting will avoid later run-time performance hits)
- Added a reference counting keyword manager (and keyword object) so
  that all enries will be composed of the same keywords when they are
  are in common.
- Fixed many memory leaks, although many still exist.
- Swapped out the MD5 implementation; will be testing endianess issues
- Fixed many crash bugs (possible strlen on null ptr error)
- Fixed a crash bug in nesyslog unregister method
- Fixed a bug in the client and server that didn't properly remove
  peers and users, respectively, that had polling errors
- Added a TTL on connected peers (similar to connected users on the
  server side)
- Added removal of peers on error or timeout.
- Fixed a subtle, yet ultra-important polling bug found both in the
  server and the client.

	
NESHARE 0.2.4 RELEASE NOTES:
----------------------------
Changes:
- Fixed a crash bug in the client library regarding the use of a stack
  based variable which performs better when dynamically allocated.
- Added a server side per-user write lock to make sure that no messages
  are intermixed in the data stream when sent from the server to a
  given user.
- Fixed a crash bug that could try to send a search result from an
  entry that's been invalidated (by the removal of the user by another
  thread before result sending has been compelted)
